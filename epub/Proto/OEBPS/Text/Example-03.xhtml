<h1>Holy Design</h1>

<p>'Come on, then,' said the Queen, 'and he shall tell you his history,'</p>

<p>As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,  to the company generally, 'You are all pardoned.' 'Come, THAT'S a good  thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the  number of executions the Queen had ordered.</p>

<p>They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.  (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) 'Up, lazy  thing!' said the Queen, 'and take this young lady to see the Mock  Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some  executions I have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with  the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on  the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go  after that savage Queen: so she waited.</p>

<p>The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till  she was out of sight: then it chuckled. 'What fun!' said the Gryphon,  half to itself, half to Alice.</p>

<p>'What IS the fun?' said Alice.</p>

<p>'Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. 'It's all her fancy, that: they never  executes nobody, you know. Come on!'</p>

<p>'Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went slowly  after it: 'I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!'</p>

<p>They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,  sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came  nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She  pitied him deeply. 'What is his sorrow?' she asked the Gryphon, and the  Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, 'It's all his  fancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on!'</p>

<p>So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes  full of tears, but said nothing.</p>

<p>'This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, 'she wants for to know your  history, she do.'</p>

<li>Much of this was over the heads of the boys, but they strove to  comprehend dimly this tale of the past</li>

<li>"What was them stone houses for?" Hare-Lip queried</li>

<li>"You remember when your dad taught you to swim?" The boy nodded</li>

<li>"Well, in the University of California&mdash;that is the name we had for  the houses&mdash;we taught young men and women how to think, just as I have  taught you now, by sand and pebbles and shells, to know how many people  lived in those days</li>

<p>Much of this was over the heads of the boys, but they strove to  comprehend dimly this tale of the past.</p>

<p>"What was them stone houses for?" Hare-Lip queried.</p>

<p>"You remember when your dad taught you to swim?" The boy nodded.  "Well, in the University of California&mdash;that is the name we had for  the houses&mdash;we taught young men and women how to think, just as I have  taught you now, by sand and pebbles and shells, to know how many people  lived in those days. There was very much to teach. The young men and  women we taught were called students. We had large rooms in which we  taught. I talked to them, forty or fifty at a time, just as I am talking  to you now. I told them about the books other men had written before  their time, and even, sometimes, in their time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was that all you did?&mdash;just talk, talk, talk?" Hoo-Hoo demanded. "Who  hunted your meat for you? and milked the goats? and caught the fish?"</p>

<p>"A sensible question, Hoo-Hoo, a sensible question. As I have told you,  in those days food-getting was easy. We were very wise. A few men got  the food for many men. The other men did other things. As you say, I  talked. I talked all the time, and for this food was given me&mdash;much  food, fine food, beautiful food, food that I have not tasted in sixty  years and shall never taste again. I sometimes think the most wonderful  achievement of our tremendous civilization was food&mdash;its inconceivable  abundance, its infinite variety, its marvellous delicacy. O my  grandsons, life was life in those days, when we had such wonderful  things to eat."</p>

<p>This was beyond the boys, and they let it slip by, words and thoughts,  as a mere senile wandering in the narrative.</p>

<p>"Our food-getters were called freemen. This was a joke. We of the  ruling classes owned all the land, all the machines, everything. These  food-getters were our slaves. We took almost all the food they got, and  left them a little so that they might eat, and work, and get us more  food&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'd have gone into the forest and got food for myself," Hare-Lip  announced; "and if any man tried to take it away from me, I'd have  killed him."</p>

<p>The old man laughed.</p>

<p>"Did I not tell you that we of the ruling class owned all the land, all  the forest, everything? Any food-getter who would not get food for us,  him we punished or compelled to starve to death. And very few did that.  They preferred to get food for us, and make clothes for us, and prepare  and administer to us a thousand&mdash;a mussel-shell, Hoo-Hoo&mdash;a thousand  satisfactions and delights. And I was Professor Smith in those  days&mdash;Professor James Howard Smith. And my lecture courses were very  popular&mdash;that is, very many of the young men and women liked to hear me  talk about the books other men had written.</p>
