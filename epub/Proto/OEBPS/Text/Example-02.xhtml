<p class="no-indent bigger margin-top margin-bottom">As the Monkey King finished his story Dorothy looked down and saw the green, shining walls of the Emerald City before them.  She wondered at the rapid flight of the Monkeys, but was glad the journey was over. The strange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of the City, the King bowed low to Dorothy, and then flew swiftly away, followed by all his band.</p>

<p class="no-indent">"That was a good ride," said the little girl.</p>

<p>"Yes, and a quick way out of our troubles," replied the Lion.  "How lucky it was you brought away that wonderful Cap!"</p>

<p>The four travelers walked up to the great gate of Emerald City and rang the bell.  After ringing several times, it was opened by the same Guardian of the Gates they had met before.</p>

<p>"What! are you back again?" he asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Do you not see us?" answered the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"But I thought you had gone to visit the Wicked Witch of the West."</p>

<p>"We did visit her," said the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"And she let you go again?" asked the man, in wonder.</p>

<p>"She could not help it, for she is melted," explained the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"This much, Tars Tarkas, you may do for me in return for the friendship that, I must confess, I feel for you."</p>

<p>"Friendship?" he replied.  "There is no such thing, John Carter; but have your will.  I shall direct that Sarkoja cease to annoy the girl, and I myself will take the custody of the key."</p>

<p>"Unless you wish me to assume the responsibility," I said, smiling.</p>

<p>He looked at me long and earnestly before he spoke.</p>

<p>"Were you to give me your word that neither you nor Dejah Thoris would attempt to escape until after we have safely reached the court of Tal Hajus you might have the key and throw the chains into the river Iss."</p>

<p>"It were better that you held the key, Tars Tarkas," I replied</p>

<p>He smiled, and said no more, but that night as we were making camp I saw him unfasten Dejah Thoris' fetters himself.</p>


<h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Re-ink-venting</h2>

<p class="no-indent">With all his cruel ferocity and coldness there was an undercurrent of something in Tars Tarkas which he seemed ever battling to subdue. Could it be a vestige of some human instinct come back from an ancient forbear to haunt him with the horror of his people's ways!</p>

<p>As I was approaching Dejah Thoris' chariot I passed Sarkoja, and the black, venomous look she accorded me was the sweetest balm I had felt for many hours.  Lord, how she hated me!  It bristled from her so palpably that one might almost have cut it with a sword.</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Forms &amp; function</h3>

<p class="no-indent">A few moments later I saw her deep in conversation with a warrior named Zad; a big, hulking, powerful brute, but one who had never made a kill among his own chieftains, and a second name only with the metal of some chieftain.  It was this custom which entitled me to the names of either of the chieftains I had killed; in fact, some of the warriors addressed me as Dotar Sojat, a combination of the surnames of the two warrior chieftains whose metal I had taken, or, in other words, whom I had slain in fair fight.</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">How it works</h3>

<p class="no-indent">On regaining the plaza I had my third glimpse of the captive girl.  She was standing with her guards before the entrance to the audience chamber, and as I approached she gave me one haughty glance and turned her back full upon me.  The act was so womanly, so earthly womanly, that though it stung my pride it also warmed my heart with a feeling of companionship; it was good to know that someone else on Mars beside myself had human instincts of a civilized order, even though the manifestation of them was so painful and mortifying.</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">How it might feel</h3>

<p class="no-indent">Had a green Martian woman desired to show dislike or contempt she would, in all likelihood, have done it with a sword thrust or a movement of her trigger finger; but as their sentiments are mostly atrophied it would have required a serious injury to have aroused such passions in them.  Sola, let me add, was an exception; I never saw her perform a cruel or uncouth act, or fail in uniform kindliness and good nature.  She was indeed, as her fellow Martian had said of her, an atavism; a dear and precious reversion to a former type of loved and loving ancestor.</p>

<p>Seeing that the prisoner seemed the center of attraction I halted to view the proceedings.  I had not long to wait for presently Lorquas Ptomel and his retinue of chieftains approached the building and, signing the guards to follow with the prisoner entered the audience chamber.  Realizing that I was a somewhat favored character, and also convinced that the warriors did not know of my proficiency in their language, as I had pleaded with Sola to keep this a secret on the grounds that I did not wish to be forced to talk with the men until I had perfectly mastered the Martian tongue, I chanced an attempt to enter the audience chamber and listen to the proceedings.</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Screen-breading</h3>

<p class="no-indent">The council squatted upon the steps of the rostrum, while below them stood the prisoner and her two guards.  I saw that one of the women was Sarkoja, and thus understood how she had been present at the hearing of the preceding day, the results of which she had reported to the occupants of our dormitory last night.  Her attitude toward the captive was most harsh and brutal.  When she held her, she sunk her rudimentary nails into the poor girl's flesh, or twisted her arm in a most painful manner.  When it was necessary to move from one spot to another she either jerked her roughly, or pushed her headlong before her.  She seemed to be venting upon this poor defenseless creature all the hatred, cruelty, ferocity, and spite of her nine hundred years, backed by unguessable ages of fierce and brutal ancestors.</p>

<p>The other woman was less cruel because she was entirely indifferent; if the prisoner had been left to her alone, and fortunately she was at night, she would have received no harsh treatment, nor, by the same token would she have received any attention at all.</p>

<h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">What if there is no layout?</h2>

<p class="no-indent">As Lorquas Ptomel raised his eyes to address the prisoner they fell on me and he turned to Tars Tarkas with a word, and gesture of impatience. Tars Tarkas made some reply which I could not catch, but which caused Lorquas Ptomel to smile; after which they paid no further attention to me.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" asked Lorquas Ptomel, addressing the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Dejah Thoris, daughter of Mors Kajak of Helium."</p>

<p>"And the nature of your expedition?" he continued.</p>

<p>"It was a purely scientific research party sent out by my father's father, the Jeddak of Helium, to rechart the air currents, and to take atmospheric density tests," replied the fair prisoner, in a low, well-modulated voice.</p>
