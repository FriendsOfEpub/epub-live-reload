  <p>"Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale&mdash;no."</p>

  <p>"Very good, then; good bye now, and I'll call again in a minute."</p>

  <p>Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two hands into a trumpet and shouted&mdash;"No, Sir! No!" Upon which Ahab retired, and Stubb returned to the Frenchman.</p>

  <p>He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the chains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of bag.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with your nose, there?" said Stubb. "Broke it?"</p>

  <p>"I wish it was broken, or that I didn't have any nose at all!" answered the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was at very much. "But what are you holding YOURS for?"</p>

<hr/>

  <p>"Oh, nothing! It's a wax nose; I have to hold it on. <a class="link" href="#">Fine day, ain't it?</a> Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will ye, Bouton-de-Rose?"</p>

  <p>"What in the devil's name do you want here?" roared the Guernseyman, flying into a sudden passion.</p>

  <p>"Oh! keep cool&mdash;cool? yes, that's the word! why don't you pack those whales in ice while you're working at 'em? But joking aside, though; do you know, Rose-bud, that it's all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn't a gill in his whole carcase."</p>

  <p>"I know that well enough; but, d'ye see, the Captain here won't believe it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before. But come aboard, and mayhap he'll believe you, if he won't me; and so I'll get out of this dirty scrape."</p>

  <h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">“Any minimal something”</h2>

  <p>I accompanied Sola and Dejah Thoris in a search for new quarters, which we found in a building nearer the audience chamber and of far more pretentious architecture than our former habitation. We also found in this building real sleeping apartments with ancient beds of highly wrought metal swinging from enormous gold chains depending from the marble ceilings. The decoration of the walls was most elaborate, and, unlike the frescoes in the other buildings I had examined, portrayed many human figures in the compositions. These were of people like myself, and of a much lighter color than Dejah Thoris. They were clad in graceful, flowing robes, highly ornamented with metal and jewels, and their luxuriant hair was of a beautiful golden and reddish bronze. The men were beardless and only a few wore arms. The scenes depicted for the most part, a fair-skinned, fair-haired people at play.</p>

  <p>Dejah Thoris clasped her hands with an exclamation of rapture as she gazed upon these magnificent works of art, wrought by a people long extinct; while Sola, on the other hand, apparently did not see them.</p>

  <div class="float-left w-25 margin-right-5"><img alt="" src="../Images/1x1.jpg"/></div>	

  <p>We decided to use this room, on the second floor and overlooking the plaza, for Dejah Thoris and Sola, and another room adjoining and in the rear for the cooking and supplies. I then dispatched Sola to bring the bedding and such food and utensils as she might need, telling her that I would guard Dejah Thoris until her return.</p>

  <p>As Sola departed Dejah Thoris turned to me with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"And whereto, then, would your prisoner escape should you leave her, unless it was to follow you and crave your protection, and ask your pardon for the cruel thoughts she has harbored against you these past few days?"</p>

  <p>"You are right," I answered, "there is no escape for either of us unless we go together."</p>

  <p>"I heard your challenge to the creature you call Tars Tarkas, and I think I understand your position among these people, but what I cannot fathom is your statement that you are not of Barsoom."</p>

  <h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">“I may be a maximalist”</h2>

  <p>"In the name of my first ancestor, then," she continued, "where may you be from? You are like unto my people, and yet so unlike. You speak my language, and yet I heard you tell Tars Tarkas that you had but learned it recently. All Barsoomians speak the same tongue from the ice-clad south to the ice-clad north, though their written languages differ. Only in the valley Dor, where the river Iss empties into the lost sea of Korus, is there supposed to be a different language spoken, and, except in the legends of our ancestors, there is no record of a Barsoomian returning up the river Iss, from the shores of Korus in the valley of Dor. Do not tell me that you have thus returned! They would kill you horribly anywhere upon the surface of Barsoom if that were true; tell me it is not!"</p>

<hr/>

  <p>Her eyes were filled with a strange, weird light; her voice was pleading, and her little hands, reached up upon my breast, were pressed against me as though to wring a denial from my very heart.</p>

  <p>"I do not know your customs, Dejah Thoris, but in my own Virginia a gentleman does not lie to save himself; I am not of Dor; I have never seen the mysterious Iss; the lost sea of Korus is still lost, so far as I am concerned. Do you believe me?"</p>
